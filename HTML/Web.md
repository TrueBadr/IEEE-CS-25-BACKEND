# *How the Web Works*
- the world wide web consists of *Client*, *Server*, *IP Address*, *ISP*, *Domain*,*TCP/IP*,*URL*,*Host* and *Port Number* and etc... .
- The documents that make up the Web are written in a specialized format called HTML HTML (Hyper text Markup Language) is the language that allows documents to be linked together using hypertext (AKA hyperlinks, AKA links). HTML contains both the content to be displayed and a description of the content. Web browsers us CSS to decide how things on a web page look and JavaScript to decide how things on a web page act.
- A server is a computer that stores the HTML documents, ready to be "served" to anyone who asks for them. Requests for Web documents are made over HTTP using URLs (Unifrom Resource Locators). When a server receives a request, it looks for the HTML document associated with the given URL. Modern web servers often create the HTML document as it is requested

# *Difference between http and https*

| http                                                                                                                                                                | https                                                                |

| HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.It is invented by Tim Berner                                                                                           | HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure                 |
| HTTP provides a standard between a web browser and a web server to establish communication. It is a set of rules for transferring data from one computer to another | HTTPS is more secure than HTTP because HTTPS is certified by the SSL |
| HTTP speed is faster than HTTPS.                                                                                                                                    | HTTPS speed is slower than HTTP.                                     |
| HTTP is used to transfer text, video, and images via web pages.                                                                                                     | HTTPS is used to transfer data securely via a network.               |

# *Web Servers*
- A web server is a system that stores and delivers web pages to users. It uses the HTTP/HTTPS protocol to handle requests from browsers and sends back things like HTML files, images, and videos.
- and it works
	- Client Request: In the web browser the user enters a URL.
	- DNS : To get the IP address of the requested domain, the browser contacts a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
	- Connecting to the Web Server: Using the obtained IP address the browser establishes a connection with the web server.
	- Processing Request: The web server receives the request and processes it.
	- Serving the Response: The requested files(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images ) are sent back to the client’s browser by the web server.
	- Rendering the Web Page: Based on the received data the browser displays the web page to the user.

# *What is DNS?*
- The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain name, like [ICPC Zagazig Community](https://icpczagazig.org/)and [IEEE Zagazig Branch](https://www.facebook.com/IEEEZSB/)
- Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
- Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device .
