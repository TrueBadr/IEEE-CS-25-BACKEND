# *What is the database*
- a database is a collection of data stored and collected in a certain way and put into a software program that saves it and allow users to `manage` and r`etrieve` it called (**DBMS**) *Database Management System*.
- - - - -
# *Why does the database exists*
- database are so important to `manage` , `retrieve` and `organize` data easily and efficiently and help user to analyze the data to extracting beneficial information from it.

# *What is the SQL*
- **SQL** is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
- **SQL** stands for Structured Query Language
- its a bunch of a instructions used to access , modify and delete stored data in a *DBMS*
- **RDBMS** is a basis of a SQL where data are stored in tables consists of Rows and columns 
- - - - 
# *What is the History of SQL*
- **SQL** is introduced in 1970s and developed by IBM Scientists *Donald Chamberlin* and *Raymond Boyce*
  it became commercially available in 1979 and it became the standard of **RDBMS** (Relational Database Management System).

# *The Most 5 Famous Databases in the world and why* 
 1. **Oracle**
    -  the oldest and most famous Database in the world , was developed in 1977 by **Lawrence Ellison** some of its great features security , scalability and recovery
 2. **MySQL**
     - is an open-source that is most used in the world . **MySQL** was developed in 1995  
     - its a *RDBMS* and Free to use unlike Oracle 
1. **Microsoft SQL Server** 
     - is a  popular database in the world  that was developed by  *Microsoft* in 1989
     - it was written in **C** and **C++** 
2. **PostgreSQL**
     - is an open-source **DBMS** that is very popular It supports many advanced programming languages such as Java, Ruby.
3. **MongoDB**
     - is an open-source database developed in the year 2009
     - It stores data in format of a document  which means the data are not stored using rows and columns so its called *Non Relational Database Management System*

# *What is RDBMS ?* 
-  **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System**  is a type of *DBMS* where data are collected and stored data in a *tabular format consists of rows and columns* , most famous **RDBMS** now is *SQL* , *MySQL* and *Oracle*.

# *RDBMS Vs DBMS*
- **DBMS** is a software program that used to `store` , `access` , `organize` and `delete `collected data called Database
- as we said previously that **RDBMS** is a type of **DBMS** where database are stored in a *tabular format consists of rows and columns*.

| Data is stored in a database management system (DBMS) as a file                                  | Tables are used to store information                                                                         |
| Data is stored in a database management system (DBMS) in either a tabular or hierarchical format | Data is stored in a relational  database management system RDBMS only in a tabular format as column and rows |
| Software and hardware requirements are minimal                                                   | Higher hardware and software requirements are required                                                       |

# *Naming Convenient*
1. *SQL Rule* that table must be less than 128 characters 
2. The first letter must be a letter as defined by **Unicode Standard** 
3. all characters can be 
    1. letters defined in Unicode Standard
    2. decimal letters from either basic Latin or national scripts
    3. The at sign(@), the dollar sign($) and the hash sign(#)
    4. The Underscore , used to represent spaces 
4. spaces , embedded characters , reserved names aren't allowed because they aren't portable
