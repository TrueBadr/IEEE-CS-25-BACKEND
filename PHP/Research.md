# *What is PHP*
- PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.
- PHP was introduced byÂ *Rasmus Lerdorf*Â inÂ *1994*.
- and PHP Stands for Personal Home Page
- Its version
    1. **PHP 3 (1998):**Â The first version considered suitable for widespread use.
    2. **PHP 4 (2000):**Â Improved performance and the introduction of the Zend Engine.
    3.  **PHP 5 (2004):**Â Added object-oriented programming features.
    4. **PHP 7 (2015):**Â Significant performance improvements and reduced memory usage.
    5. **PHP 8 (2020):**Â Introduction of Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, further enhancing performance.

# *Types of Errors in PHP*
1. **Parse error or syntax error**
	- t is the type of error done by the programmer in the source code of the program. The syntax error is caught by the compiler.
2. **Fetal error**
	- It is the type of error where PHP compiler understand the PHP code but it recognizes an undeclared function. This means that function is called without the definition of function.
3. **Warning Errors**
    - The main reason of warning errors are including a missing file. This means that the PHP function call the missing file.
4. **Notice Error**
    - It is similar to warning error. It means that the program contains something wrong but it allows the execution of script.

# *Echo VS Print*

| **Echo**                                                                                  | **Print**                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| echo accepts a list of arguments (multiple arguments can be passed), separated by commas. | The print accepts only one argument at a time. |
| It does not return any value.                                                             | it returns the value 1.                        |
| It displays the outputs of one or more strings separated by commas.                       | The print outputs only the strings.            |
| It is comparatively faster than the print statement.                                      | It is slower than an echo statement.           |

# *Sensitivity in PHP*
- PHP isÂ **partially case-sensitive**. PHP constructs, function names, class names are case-insensitive, whereas variables are case-sensitive. A statement ends with a semicolon (;). Whitespace and line breaks don't matter in PHP.
- - - - - - 
# *Assign By Value And By Reference*
- in *PHP* the variables are by default assigned by the value i give value to a variable , then assign another variable with the first value , so the two variables has the same values and when i change one of them the other do not relate to the change .
- another way to assign variables is assigning by reference where when i assign the second variable with the first with sign '&' now the connected with address so when i change one of them the other change also to the new value assigned.

# *Static and Dynamic Typing: What Are the Main Differences*
- when in a language define a variable there are two types of typing . In static languages i need to choose and write the specific type of data i need to assign like in C++ , Java , Rust ``` int X = 5 ```.
- In Dynamic typing language you do not need to write the type of data you insert in IDE or text editor , the compiler itself will recognize the type of variable.

# *Whatâ€™s the difference between Scripting and Programming Languages?*
- a scripting language is Â a language that uses a naive method to bring codes to a runtime environment like (Ruby , JavaScript , Python).
- a programming language is a Â language which is used by humans to navigate their communication with computers. (C++ , Java , PHP).

# *What is the difference between for and Foreach loop in PHP ?*
- TheÂ __for__Â loop works at the end of the given condition. It is used for the implementation of variables and works in a single way. TheÂ __for__Â loop does not work in the case of associative arrays and Consist of three portions or parts (initialized Variable , Condition , increment/decrement)
- TheÂ *foreach*Â loop works at the end of the array count. This loop can work with variables as well as. Therefore, this loop can be implemented in more than one way.

| **For**                                                                                                                                | **Foreach**                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The iteration is clearly visible. The block of code is repeated as long as the condition is met or the counter meets a specific value. | The iteration is hidden. The block of code is repeated until iterating over the array is completed. |
| Good performance.                                                                                                                      | Better performance.                                                                                 |
| The stop condition is specified easily.                                                                                                | The stop condition has to be explicitly specified.                                                  |
