	# *Types of Errors in PHP*

	# *Echo VS Print*
	
	| **Echo**                                                                                  | **Print**                                      |
	| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
	| echo accepts a list of arguments (multiple arguments can be passed), separated by commas. | The print accepts only one argument at a time. |
	| It does not return any value.                                                             | it returns the value 1.                        |
	| It displays the outputs of one or more strings separated by commas.                       | The print outputs only the strings.            |
	| It is comparatively faster than the print statement.                                      | It is slower than an echo statement.           |

	# *Sensitivity in PHP*
